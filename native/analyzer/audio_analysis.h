// Offline whole-track analysis: envelope, transition, tempo, key, spectral,
// and structure features, entirely DSP -- no ML model. `samples` is
// contiguous, non-interleaved mono Float32 PCM. Callers normally supply
// finite normalized amplitudes in [-1, 1], normally at 11,025 Hz, and a
// duration in seconds equal to samples.size() / sample_rate. The
// implementation guards empty/very-low-rate input, but the JNI bridge owns
// stricter validation; it does not scan every sample or reconcile
// inconsistent duration metadata.
//
// Calls borrow the input vector only until they return and produce results
// that own all vector/string storage. Analysis is reentrant because every
// mutable value is call-local. It intentionally allocates and performs O(n)
// work, so it belongs on a worker thread and must never run in a real-time
// audio callback.
