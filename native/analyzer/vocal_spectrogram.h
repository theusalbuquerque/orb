// Linear-frequency STFT magnitude front end for the open-unmix vocal
// separation model.
//
// Every constant here is dictated by the trained network, not chosen: the
// model was trained on exactly this STFT (torch.stft with these settings,
// see openunmix/transforms.py's TorchSTFT, MIT-licensed, Inria/SigSep), and
// a front end that differs in window convention or normalization feeds it
// something it has never seen -- the same lesson the Beat This mel front end
// already encodes, see mel_spectrogram.h.
//
// `channels` is planar (non-interleaved) stereo Float32 PCM that must
// already be at kVocalSpectrogramSampleRate; the caller owns resampling and
// mono duplication. Calls borrow the input only until they return, own all
// returned storage, and are reentrant. The work is O(n log n) and allocates,
// so it belongs on a worker thread.
