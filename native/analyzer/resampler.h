// Sample-rate conversion for the DSP analyzer's front end.
//
// The analyzer accepts exactly kAnalysisSampleRate (see audio_analysis.h /
// TrackFeatures.kt) and refuses anything else, so something has to convert;
// streams arrive at 44.1 or 48 kHz. Doing it by dropping samples would fold
// everything above the analyzer's Nyquist back down into the band it reads,
// and an aliased spectrum produces a wrong tempo/key/structure reading rather
// than a noisy one -- the transition planner would then take that reading at
// face value. So this is a windowed-sinc resampler rather than decimation:
// the anti-alias filter is the point of it.
//
// Calls borrow the input only until they return, own the returned storage,
// and are reentrant. The work is O(taps * output) and allocates, so it
// belongs on a worker thread alongside the rest of analysis.
