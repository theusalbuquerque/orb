// Log-mel spectrogram front end for the Beat This! beat/downbeat model.
//
// Every constant here is dictated by the trained network, not chosen: the
// model was trained on torchaudio's MelSpectrogram with these exact
// settings, and a front end that differs even in window convention or
// normalization feeds it something it has never seen. They mirror
// `LogMelSpect` in the upstream project (CPJKU/beat_this, MIT) and its C++
// port (mosynthkey/beat_this_cpp, MIT), which is the reference this was
// written against.
//
// `samples` is contiguous mono Float32 PCM that must already be at
// kBeatSpectrogramSampleRate; the caller owns resampling. Calls borrow the
// input only until they return, own all returned storage, and are
// reentrant. The work is O(n log n) and allocates, so it belongs on a
// worker thread.
