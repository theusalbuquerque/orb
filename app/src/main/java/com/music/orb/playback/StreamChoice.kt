/**
 * Which copy of a track is being served, remembered for as long as the track
 * is being served from it.
 *
 * ExoPlayer opens a source many times over one play: the initial read, a seek
 * past the buffer, a resume, and — the one that matters here — the
 * continuation fetch when playback reaches the end of what the cache holds.
 * Every one of those goes back through the resolving data source, and until
 * this existed, every one of them was free to come back with a *different*
 * answer.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. Measured on this device: a track started on
 * YouTube with 57 seconds pre-buffered, played to the end of those 57 seconds,
 * and its continuation fetch resolved — correctly, by its own lights — to a
 * module's 320kbps AAC instead. The player was handed the middle of an MP4
 * where it expected the rest of a WebM, and `MatroskaExtractor` threw
 * `EOFException`:
 *
 * ```
 *   12:09:04  first audio          (YouTube Opus, buffered position 57761)
 *   12:10:12  Source error
 *             Caused by: java.io.EOFException
 *               at MatroskaExtractor.read
 * ```
 *
 * Two sources cannot share one cache entry, and [AudioCache]'s key factory
 * cannot tell them apart: it runs *before* the resolve, off the
 * `orb://watch?v=…` URI, and at that point which server will answer is
 * not yet known. So the fix goes the other way round — the entry does not
 * learn who is filling it, the resolver is held to whoever filled it first.
 *
 * [QualityUpgrade] already worked this way for the streams it swaps in, for
 * exactly the same reason, and the reasoning simply hadn't been carried back
 * to the first resolve.
 *
 * ### Why a time limit
 *
 * A module's stream URL is signed and expires — around five hours, on the
 * catalogues in use here. Holding one indefinitely would eventually hand the
 * player a dead URL rather than a wrong one, which is no better. [TTL_MS] is
 * far inside every expiry seen, so a choice is either reused while it is
 * certainly still good or made again from scratch.

     * substitution is deterministic — the same module, asked the same query for
     * the same tier, answers with the same URL — and it is also *fast*, because
     * by the second attempt its index and its module are cached. So a retry
     * that is free to substitute again wins the race against YouTube by the
     * same margin it won it the first time, and resolves straight back to the
     * URL that just failed. Three attempts of that is a track that never plays
     * at all, while a working YouTube URL sits in
     * [StreamResolver][com.music.orb.data.innertube.StreamResolver]'s cache
     * unused.
     *
     * ### Why this expires
     *
     * The first version of this held a refusal for the life of the process, on
     * the reasoning that a deterministic search deserves a permanent answer.
     * Nothing measured supports going that far. What still reaches here is a URL
     * that was well formed and would not serve anyway, and the ordinary causes
     * of that — a signature that expired between minting and use, a backend
     * having a bad minute — clear up by themselves. Held forever, one of those
     * would cost the lossless copy of every track it touched for the rest of the
     * session: a real loss traded against an unproven gain. So the refusal is a
     * cooling-off period, not a verdict — long enough to get the track playing
     * and keep it playing, short enough to ask again in the same sitting.
     *
     * Most of what used to arrive here doesn't any more: [ModuleSource.malformed]
     * rejects a URL carrying its own origin twice before anything tries to play
     * it. This is the net under that, for the failures only playback can find.
