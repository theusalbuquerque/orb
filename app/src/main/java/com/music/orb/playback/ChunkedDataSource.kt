/**
 * Fetches a stream as a run of bounded ranges instead of one open-ended read.
 *
 * googlevideo paces a continuous response down to roughly playback speed:
 * ask for a whole track in one request and it arrives at about 15kB/s, barely
 * ahead of the rate it is being consumed at. Ask for the same bytes as bounded
 * ranges and each one is served at line rate — measured on the same track,
 * over the same connection, seconds apart:
 *
 * ```
 *   GET (unbounded)               15.5 kB/s
 *   Range: bytes=0-2097151         5.7 MB/s
 * ```
 *
 * That is the difference between a player that can build a buffer and one that
 * can only just keep up, and it is why a stall never recovers into a cushion:
 * there is no spare bandwidth to catch up with.
 *
 * [AudioCache] already fetches this way — it is why read-ahead can put a whole
 * track on disk in the time between songs. This puts the player's own reads on
 * the same footing, which matters for the track being listened to right now:
 * read-ahead deliberately never touches it (Media3 locks a cache entry to one
 * writer), so without this it is the one track that always streams throttled.
 *
 * Transparent to everything above it. [CacheDataSource][androidx.media3.datasource.cache.CacheDataSource]
 * sees one continuous stream of the length it asked for, and a request that is
 * already bounded — every read-ahead fetch — is passed straight through
 * untouched rather than chunked twice.
