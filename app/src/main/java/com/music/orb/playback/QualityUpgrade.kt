/**
 * The second look: a track that started on less than was asked for gets the
 * question asked again, properly, while it plays.
 *
 * The live path has to answer in the time a listener will wait for a track to
 * start, and it buys that by giving up on the slow catalogue — which is
 * regularly the one holding the lossless copy. Measured on this device: the
 * fastest module answered a search in 1.3s and the slowest in 5.4s, and the
 * slow one then took a further 8.2s to walk its own fallback chain down to a
 * 128kbps MP3. Waiting for all of that costs 14 seconds of silence; not
 * waiting costs the FLAC. Neither is a good trade, and neither has to be made
 * once the search can happen with sound already coming out of the speaker.
 *
 * So: play whatever can be had now, then look again with no time limit, and
 * swap only if the answer is genuinely the same recording *and* genuinely
 * better than what is playing — which is usually the lossless copy that was
 * asked for, but is also a 320kbps module stream against YouTube's 160kbps
 * Opus. See [SourceResolver.worthSwapping] for where that line is drawn.
 * The swap is not free — ExoPlayer cannot change sources
 * gaplessly mid-track, so there is a short break in the audio — which is why
 * every guard here errs towards not doing it. A missed upgrade is a quieter
 * failure than an interrupted song.
 *
 * ### How the swap reaches the player
 *
 * The queue holds `orb://watch?v=…` URIs that
 * [PlaybackService][PlaybackService]'s resolving data source turns into real
 * URLs at open time. An upgrade re-points that indirection rather than
 * touching the queue: the stream is parked in [forced], the item is replaced
 * with the same URI plus a `q=` marker, and the marker does two jobs — it
 * makes the item unequal to its old self so Media3 actually rebuilds the media
 * source, and it keys the disk cache separately so the FLAC is not written
 * into the middle of the half-cached MP3 it is replacing.

     *   lossy clears, which quietly narrowed the whole path to lossless-only.
     *   Measured on the track that was reported — 'The Night We Met', upgraded
     *   to Tidal's AAC 320 in one session and restarted into its YouTube Opus:
     *
     *   ```
     *     17:39:47.471  90DKXLbzLto <- audio/opus 48.0kHz bitrate n/a

     *     ——— nothing ———
     *   ```
     *
     *   The second look ran, found the same 320kbps copy it had swapped in
     *   twenty minutes earlier, and [SourceResolver.worthSwapping] dropped all
     *   three on `playing?.kbps ?: return false`. There is no lossless copy of
     *   that track behind any configured module — the one advertising FLAC in
     *   search serves AAC from its stream endpoint — so the listener got the
     *   "Upgrading Quality" badge, then silence on it, then Opus for the rest
     *   of the session. Against the real floor the gain is 320 − ~160, which
     *   clears [SourceResolver.worthSwapping]'s minimum twice over.

    /**
     * Abandons the second look for every track at once, because the player all
     * of it was about is gone.
     *
     * Everything in this file is scoped to the *process*, and the player it
     * describes is scoped to [PlaybackService][PlaybackService]. Those are not
     * the same lifetime: closing the app destroys the service — by
     * `onTaskRemoved`, or by the session simply being stopped — and Android
     * routinely keeps the process to stand a new one up in. So a second service
     * inherits the first one's verdicts, and the one verdict that matters is
     * [asked].
     *
     * That is the whole of "it never comes back to lossless again". Measured on
     * one track, with the process surviving throughout — a single log buffer
     * holds both halves:
     *
     * ```
     *   15:12:06  auditioning upgraded AdEKgwUqPKI … (FLAC)
     *   15:12:11  upgraded to FLAC at 4759ms       ← and so: asked += AdEKgwUqPKI
     *   ——— app closed, service destroyed, process kept ———
     *   15:13:38  AdEKgwUqPKI <- audio/opus 48.0kHz
     *             (no second look, no search, nothing)
     * ```
     *
     * The restored track plays the lossy copy for a reason that is correct on
     * its own: the rendition marker lives on the item URI, [LastPlayed] does not
     * store it, and the base cache entry still holds YouTube's fully-fetched
     * Opus — so the bytes come straight off disk with no resolve at all. What is
     * supposed to happen next is [adoptUnresolved], which exists for precisely
     * that track and says so. It never ran: [couldStillUpgrade] found the id in
     * [asked], put there by last session's *successful* upgrade, and refused.
     * And because [asked] never expires, skipping away and back could not clear
     * it either.
     *
     * So the sets that are meant to outlive a queue movement are given the one
     * boundary they were missing. Called before the queue is restored, which
     * makes a warm restart behave like a cold one — see
     * [PlaybackService.onCreate].
     *
     * [StreamChoice] is deliberately *not* reset alongside this. It records
     * which source is filling each on-disk cache entry, those entries outlive
     * the process, and letting a fresh resolve pick a different source for a
     * half-filled one is the corruption it was written to prevent.
