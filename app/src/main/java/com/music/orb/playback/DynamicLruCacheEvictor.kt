/**
 * [androidx.media3.datasource.cache.LeastRecentlyUsedCacheEvictor], except the
 * ceiling is a `var` rather than baked into the constructor.
 *
 * [SimpleCache] can only be opened once per process, so a settings change
 * can't just build a new one with a bigger evictor — this is what lets the
 * limit move without tearing the cache down and reopening it, which would
 * orphan the [CacheDataSource][androidx.media3.datasource.cache.CacheDataSource]
 * the player already holds a reference to.
 *
 * ## Why the opening of a track is treated differently
 *
 * Plain LRU has a pathology here that took a while to see. A track's first
 * bytes are read once, when playback starts, and never touched again; its tail
 * is read continuously as the listener keeps listening. So the head is always
 * the oldest span a track owns, and plain LRU always evicts it first. Measured
 * on the reference device with a full cache: 48 of 170 spans still began at
 * byte 0 — most tracks were sitting on disk almost complete, with their
 * openings gone.
 *
 * That is invisible for playback, which re-fetches whatever it needs. It is
 * fatal for Automix, whose analyzer can only decode from the start of a
 * container: a track holding 95% of itself but nothing at byte 0 reads as
 * entirely uncached, and is silently never analysed. Worse, with the cache at
 * its ceiling a track downloading its own tail could evict its own head while
 * still playing.
 *
 * So head spans are held back from eviction, up to [headBudgetBytes] in total.
 * The budget matters: heads are never re-read, so nothing would ever age them
 * out, and an unbounded exemption would fill the cache with openings. Past the
 * budget the oldest protected head is released back to ordinary LRU, which is
 * both a bound and roughly the right policy — the tracks you played longest ago
 * are the ones least likely to come round again.
