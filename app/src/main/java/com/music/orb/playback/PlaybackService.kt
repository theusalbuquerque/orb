     *    the FLAC a previous session upgraded to, and hunting a lossless copy
     *    of a track that is already lossless buys a break in the audio for
     *    nothing. An unknown codec is not read as "lossy": it means the
     *    renderer has not been configured yet, so the track is left un-adopted
     *    and the progress sampler asks again a few seconds later. A codec the
     *    renderer is reporting for *some other track* gets the same treatment,
     *    and has to, because it is indistinguishable from an answer — see
     *    [audioFormatFor] for what it cost to read one on trust.
     *  - **Whether the listener owns the file.** A downloaded track resolves to
     *    its own copy on disk — see the resolving data source above, which
     *    answers it before the module race is ever reached, so a download has
     *    never been a candidate for substitution. Reproduced here because this
     *    path skips that resolver entirely; without it the second look would
     *    spend data replacing a file the user deliberately saved.
     *
     * @param durationSec the runtime the decoder reports, waited for by the

     * `replaceMediaItem` + `prepare` tears the old source down first and builds
     * the new one from nothing: a connection to the CDN, a container header, a

     * every time, and the whole of it was spent doing work that had no reason to
     * wait for the music to stop.
     *
     * So it doesn't. A throwaway player opens the same upgraded URI, seeked to
     * where the listener is, and fills the *same on-disk cache entry* the real
     * player will read from — [QualityUpgrade.MARKER] keys that entry apart from
     * the rendition being replaced, which is what makes this safe. When the swap
     * finally happens the bytes are already local, the container is already
     * known to parse, and what is left is a decoder init. The old stream plays
     * through all of it.
     *
     * The second thing it buys is that a failed upgrade stops costing anything.
     * Every way this can go wrong — a dead URL, a 403, a truncated body, a
     * catalogue that matched the wrong cut of the song, a source that promised
     * FLAC and serves Opus — now happens to a player nobody is listening to, and
     * the answer is simply that no swap occurs. Before, all of them were
     * discovered *after* the audio had been cut, and cost a break, several
     * seconds of silence in `STATE_BUFFERING`, and a second break putting the
     * old stream back. See [watchUpgrade], which is now the backstop for this
     * rather than the first line of defence.
     *
     * Silent by construction rather than by volume: with `playWhenReady` false
     * the renderers are enabled and decode — which is all the proof needed —
     * but nothing is started and no second `AudioTrack` is ever opened. It takes
     * no audio focus and backs no session, so nothing else in the app can see it.

     * Nobody gets a head start. An earlier version gave the modules six

     * for, on the reasoning that a module answering inside that window plays
     * with no seam in it. What that actually bought, on every track the

     * client walk starting from cold — the wait and the seam, rather than one

     * track begins as soon as *anything* can serve it.
     *
     * The speculative resolve this reinstates was dropped once before, for a
     * real reason — it is several round trips to `youtubei.googleapis.com`
     * competing for the same radio and connection pool as the lookup beside
     * it, and on a track the modules do have, that work is thrown away. What
     * changed is that it is no longer speculative: YouTube is now the expected
     * outcome for anything the modules don't answer quickly, so its walk is on
     * the critical path rather than hedging one. It is also coalesced and
     * cached — see [StreamResolver.resolve] — so even a discarded walk warms
     * the URL this track will want if the upgrade later falls through.
     *
     * A module that wins the race outright still wins the track, which is the
     * one thing worth keeping from the old head start: the lossless copy plays
     * from the first note and there is no swap at all. That is a narrower
     * window than it sounds, and deliberately so — read-ahead warms the
     * YouTube URL for the queue (see [AudioCache.prefetchQueue]), so on a
     * track that was read ahead the fallback answers in milliseconds and
     * almost always wins. The swap is the ordinary path now; playing from the
     * first note is the prize for a module quick enough to beat a cached URL.

     * A lookup that loses is not cancelled. It is handed over still running,
     * because it is not wrong, only late, and the thing it is about to return
     * is exactly the stream that would have played seamlessly had it been
     * quicker. It finishes on its own time and the track swaps up to it
     * mid-song, which is the trade this whole path exists to make: a short
     * break in the audio, in exchange for the listener hearing something now
     * rather than waiting in silence for the good copy.

     * Buffers as far ahead as a whole track rather than a rolling window.
     *
     * Media3's audio default stops loading at 13 buffer segments — around 830kB,
     * or 40 seconds of a 160kbps stream — and everything past that is fetched
     * only as playback consumes it. Since the data source writes through to
     * [AudioCache], how far ahead the player loads is also how much of the
     * track ends up on disk, and a seek past the buffered part is the one that
     * has to wait on the network.
     *
     * This matters for the track playback *starts* on. Everything after it is
     * on disk in full before it is reached, read ahead while it was still the
     * queued track — a first track has had no such chance.
     *
     * The byte ceiling is what governs; the duration is set past any song so
     * that it never becomes the binding constraint.
     *
     * Two further departures from the defaults, both about how long the
     * listener waits for sound:
     *
     *  - **Back buffer.** Media3 keeps nothing behind the playhead, so a seek
     *    *backwards* drops the buffer and reloads, while a seek forwards lands
     *    in samples already held. Half a minute of history closes that gap for
     *    the seek people actually make — nudging back a few seconds to catch a
     *    lyric — and it is deliberately no longer than that. The byte ceiling
     *    above counts *everything* the player holds, history included, so a
     *    back buffer wide enough to keep a whole track would spend the entire
     *    read-ahead budget on audio already heard: past the ceiling, loading
     *    stops, and since every second played moves a second from the front of
     *    the buffer to the back, the total never falls again and it never
     *    restarts. Read-ahead collapses and the track stalls every couple of
     *    seconds for the rest of its length. Seeking further back than this
     *    window is a disk read anyway, not a network one — [AudioCache] has
     *    written every byte already played.
     *  - **Thresholds to (re)start playback.** The defaults — 2.5s of audio
     *    before starting, 5s before resuming after a rebuffer — are sized for
     *    streaming video over a network that might stall again. Here the bytes
     *    are usually already on disk, so those seconds are spent waiting on a
     *    buffer that fills instantly and are simply dead air after a seek.
     *    Resuming is given more room than starting: a stall means the network
     *    is genuinely struggling, and coming back with a second of audio in
     *    hand only buys the next stall.

     *
     * **Back restarts the track.** ExoPlayer already implements
     * restart-then-skip in [Player.seekToPrevious], gated on
     * `maxSeekToPreviousPosition`. External surfaces don't use it:
     * [DefaultMediaNotificationProvider] binds its previous button to
     * `COMMAND_SEEK_TO_PREVIOUS_MEDIA_ITEM`, which skips unconditionally. So
     * that command is redirected rather than left to behave differently
     * depending on which back button was pressed.
     *
     * **A skip cancels the crossfade.** Blending is for a track running out,
     * not for one being changed: told to move on, the listener wants the song
     * they were on to stop, not to keep playing over the one they asked for.
     * So every skip tells [CrossfadeController] to drop whatever is in flight
     * and then moves the queue plainly.
     *
     * Command availability is deliberately untouched — mutating it through a
     * [ForwardingPlayer] means intercepting listener callbacks too. The one
     * consequence is the first track of a queue, where ExoPlayer withholds
     * `COMMAND_SEEK_TO_PREVIOUS_MEDIA_ITEM` for want of a previous item: back
     * stays inert on those surfaces, exactly as it already was. In the app it
     * restarts, since that path asks for `COMMAND_SEEK_TO_PREVIOUS`.
