/**
 * Rewrites a downloaded FLAC's metadata blocks to carry title, artist, album
 * and cover art.
 *
 * The simplest of the three taggers, and the reason is worth stating because it
 * is the opposite of what the other two are shaped by. A FLAC is `fLaC`, then a
 * chain of length-prefixed metadata blocks, then the audio frames — and nothing
 * in the format addresses anything by an absolute file offset. `SEEKTABLE`
 * *looks* like the exception, but its offsets are measured from the first byte
 * of the first frame header rather than from the start of the file, so growing
 * the metadata region moves the frames without invalidating a single number in
 * it. No `stco`/`co64` cascade to patch ([Mp4Tagger]), no `Segment` size to
 * widen in place without changing its byte width ([WebmTagger]): the whole job
 * here is to emit a new block chain and copy the frames through untouched.
 *
 * What comes out is the magic, `STREAMINFO`, every other block the file already
 * had, then a fresh `VORBIS_COMMENT` and `PICTURE`. The old copies of those two
 * are dropped rather than added to — a second `VORBIS_COMMENT` is illegal, and
 * two front covers is a coin toss over which one a player shows. `PADDING` is
 * dropped as well, which is what it is there for: it exists to be spent on
 * exactly this.
 *
 * Anything that doesn't fit the shape above — a file that doesn't open with
 * `fLaC`, a block that claims more bytes than the file has, a first block that
 * isn't `STREAMINFO` — comes back as the input, unchanged and by reference, so
 * [MediaTagger] leaves the downloaded file alone.
