/**
 * Pulls a resolved stream onto disk.
 *
 * Two things here are not obvious and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **Bounded ranges, not one long GET.** googlevideo paces a continuous
 *    response down to roughly playback speed — about 15kB/s, against 5.7MB/s
 *    for the same bytes asked for as ranges. That is the difference between a
 *    four-minute track saving in a second and saving in four minutes, and it is
 *    the same finding [ChunkedDataSource][com.music.orb.playback.ChunkedDataSource]
 *    exists for.
 *  - **The client's own headers.** googlevideo bakes the identity that minted a
 *    URL into it as `c=`/`cver=` and compares that against the headers of the
 *    request that comes back for the bytes. Fetching with anything else is a
 *    403 — so the fetch is dressed as whatever the URL says made it, which
 *    [PlayerClient.forStreamUrl] can recover from the URL alone.
 *
 * Sequential rather than parallel. Ranges are served at line rate, and a
 * typical AAC track is four megabytes: splitting that across connections buys
 * nothing a user could perceive and costs the temp files and reassembly that a
 * cancelled download would then have to clean up.
 *
 * None of the above is true of a stream from a configured source rather than
 * from YouTube, which is what [fetchDirect] is for.

     * Fetch all of [url] into [sink], for a stream that isn't googlevideo's.

     * Deliberately not a parameterised [fetch], on two counts that both matter:
     *
     *  - **One GET, not ranges.** The chunk loop above exists to defeat
     *    googlevideo's pacing, and nothing else paces bytes that way. Worse, a
     *    server that ignores `Range` answers 200 with the whole file rather
     *    than 206 with the slice asked for — and that loop would then write the
     *    opening of the file into the middle of the output and commit something
     *    the right length and unplayable.
     *  - **The source's own headers.** A source hands them over alongside the
     *    URL — see [SourceStream.headers][com.music.orb.data.sources.SourceStream.headers]
     *    — and they are whatever that server binds its links to. The
     *    [PlayerClient] identity [fetch] recovers from a googlevideo URL means
     *    nothing here.
     *
     * There is no re-resolve on a refusal either. [fetch] has one because a
     * googlevideo URL is minted against a session that can be stood down
     * mid-download; a source's URL that stops working has a server behind it
     * with its own reasons, and the caller falling back to YouTube is a better
     * answer than asking again.
     *
     * @param onProgress called as bytes land, and only when the response stated
     *   a length to measure against — an unstated one leaves the progress
     *   indeterminate rather than dividing by zero.
     * @return how many bytes were written.
