/**
 * Keeps the process alive while the download queue drains, and says so.
 *
 * A download is the one thing this app does that a user starts and then leaves:
 * they tap it and put the phone in a pocket. A coroutine on a ViewModel scope
 * would be killed the moment the activity goes, and a plain background service
 * on a modern Android is killed almost as fast — so this is a foreground
 * service, which is also the only honest arrangement, since a notification is
 * exactly what the user should get for work happening out of sight.
 *
 * It owns no state. The queue and everything known about it live in
 * [Downloads]; this drives that queue and reflects it into a notification, and
 * stops itself the moment there is nothing left to do.
