 * Two things happen here that don't happen in any single [MusicSource]:
 *
 *  1. **The quality question is answered once**, from the connection in hand
 *     and the user's ceiling for it — see [requestForNow]. Sources are told
 *     what to serve; they don't each re-derive it.
 *
 *  2. **The order is applied.** A track is pinned to the source that produced
 *     it, but a pin is a starting point, not a cage: with lossless on, a
 *     higher-priority source that can serve the same recording bit-exact gets
 *     asked first, and a source that fails gets stepped over rather than
 *     failing the track.
 *
 * Whether another source *has* the same recording is [TrackMatcher]'s question,
 * not this one's. Everything here does with a candidate list is ask that, and
 * everything a source is asked for comes from the same place — so the library,
 * a playlist, radio, search and the home feed all substitute on identical
 * terms, whichever of them a track was queued from.

     *    the FLAC that had been asked for.

     *  2. **Quality decides between equals, second.** Among rows that are the

     *     to ask. This was doing that job *first*, which is how a 185-second
