/**
 * Finds the looping video that belongs behind a track's or a release's cover
 * art — Spotify's Canvas, Apple's motion artwork.
 *
 * Three sources, asked in turn until one answers. They cover genuinely
 * different ground rather than being three routes to the same catalogue:
 * Apple has the most, Tidal has square covers on a lot of what Apple misses,
 * and the community index is the only one that reaches back catalogue. Order
 * is by hit rate, so the later two are rarely reached.
 *
 * Every one of them is a public endpoint belonging to someone else, reached
 * without an account, and all of them will confidently answer a search with
 * the wrong record. So the shape of this is: ask, then re-check the answer
 * against what was asked for ([CanvasArtwork.matches]), and treat any failure
 * — network, parse, mismatch — as simply no canvas. The still art is always
 * underneath, so nothing here can break the player or the album page.
 *
 * Results are cached, misses included: nothing having a canvas is the common
 * case, and without negative caching every revisit would pay for three
 * lookups again to learn the same thing.
