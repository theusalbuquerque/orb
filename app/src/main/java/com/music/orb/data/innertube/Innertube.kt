/**
 * Minimal Innertube (youtubei) client.
 *
 * Two kinds of client identity, for different reasons:
 *
 *  - **WEB_REMIX** against music.youtube.com for browse/search/library. It
 *    returns the full YT Music shelf layout and honours the signed-in session.
 *
 *  - **A device client** for the `player` endpoint, chosen per call. Which
 *    ones Google answers changes without notice, so [player] takes the
 *    identity as an argument and [StreamResolver] walks a list of them rather
 *    than betting the app on any single one. See [PlayerClient].
 *
 * Authenticated requests are signed with Google's SAPISIDHASH scheme derived
 * from the stored cookie; no long-lived token is ever minted or stored.
