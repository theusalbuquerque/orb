/**
 * YouTube Music, wrapped so it can be ordered alongside everything else.
 *
 * A thin adapter over machinery that already exists and stays where it is:
 * [StreamResolver] keeps its client walk, its URL cache and its 403 handling,
 * and nothing about how a YouTube track resolves changes by virtue of this
 * class. What changes is that YouTube is now *one of* the sources rather than
 * the assumption underneath all of them.
 *
 * Tracks keep their bare video ids rather than being wrapped in a
 * [SourceRegistry.trackKey]. Half the app knows what a YouTube video id is —
 * the like button, the lyrics lookup keyed on it, the radio endpoint, the
 * canvas lookup, the scrobbler — and re-keying them here would break every one
 * of those for no gain, since an unwrapped id already routes to exactly this
 * source by default.
