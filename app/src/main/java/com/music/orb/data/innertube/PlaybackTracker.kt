/**
 * Registers plays against the signed-in account's YouTube Music history, so
 * recommendations on the home tab reflect what's actually been listened to.
 *
 * Two pings make one play, and both matter:
 *
 *  - `videostatsPlaybackUrl` the moment a track becomes audible. This creates
 *    the history entry.
 *  - `videostatsWatchtimeUrl` as it plays on. An entry with no watchtime
 *    behind it looks like a track that was skipped, which is close to worthless
 *    as a recommendation signal — this is what was missing before.
 *
 * Both carry the same client-playback-nonce, which is what ties them to one
 * play; a nonce reused across tracks gets the second play discarded.
 *
 * Best-effort only: any failure here must never affect playback itself.
