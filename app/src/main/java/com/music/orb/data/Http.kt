/**
 * One OkHttp client for the whole app.
 *
 * This matters: googlevideo binds a stream URL to the connection context of
 * the `player` request that minted it. If Innertube and ExoPlayer used
 * separate HTTP stacks they could resolve to different addresses (v4 vs v6)
 * and the media fetch would come back 403. Sharing the client keeps DNS,
 * address family and connection pooling identical for both.
 *
 * That sharing has a cost the defaults don't budget for. Every request the
 * app makes — [Innertube]'s player/browse calls, NewPipe's own signature and
 * `next`-endpoint fetches, [ChunkedDataSource][com.music.orb.playback.ChunkedDataSource]
 * and [AudioCache][com.music.orb.playback.AudioCache]'s multi-megabyte
 * chunk downloads, and every [StreamResolver] probe — funnels through this
 * one client, and OkHttp's stock [Dispatcher] allows only 5 requests in
 * flight to a single host at a time. A track streaming while its successor
 * pre-caches is two or three of those requests already; a resolve running
 * alongside them queues behind whichever is occupying the rest — invisibly,
 * since a request stuck in OkHttp's queue and a slow server both just look
 * like a request that took several extra seconds. Sized well past anything
 * this app actually drives concurrently, so the queue is never the reason a
 * request was slow.
