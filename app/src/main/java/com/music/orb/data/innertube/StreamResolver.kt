/**
 * Turns a videoId into a URL ExoPlayer can actually stream.
 *
 * Three things make or break this, and the order they are attempted in matters
 * as much as the mechanics of each:
 *
 *  1. **Which endpoint asks.** The `youtubei/v1/player` POST is one small JSON
 *     round trip. The watch page — what a full extractor scrape fetches — is
 *     several hundred kilobytes of HTML and is rate-shaped: under load Google
 *     answers its headers immediately and then feeds the body out over tens of
 *     seconds, or simply stops sending and never closes. That shaping is
 *     invisible as an error and reads to a listener as endless buffering, so
 *     the scrape is kept off the hot path entirely — see [newPipeUrl], the
 *     failsafe of last resort.
 *
 *  2. **Which client asks.** Google turns identities away without notice and
 *     without pattern: the client that works today answers `LOGIN_REQUIRED`
 *     next month. So [CLIENTS] is walked rather than trusted, the one that last
 *     worked is tried first, and one that is refused for a track is stood down
 *     for that track for a while.
 *
 *  3. **Whether the URL is real.** Every googlevideo URL carries an `n`
 *     parameter which, sent as-is, gets the response throttled to a crawl or
 *     refused with 403; it has to be transformed by running YouTube's own
 *     player JavaScript, which is what NewPipe's [YoutubeJavaScriptPlayerManager]
 *     does. That can fail quietly, and a URL can be dead on arrival for reasons
 *     no amount of care predicts — so nothing is handed to the player, or
 *     cached, until a single byte has been fetched from it. See [probe].

     * The extractor's own leash on [Http.client].

     * Everything NewPipe fetches — the watch page above all — goes out through
     * here, and [Http.client] sets no `callTimeout` at all. Its 30-second read
     * timeout does not stand in for one: a read timeout is per read, so a
     * response that yields a few bytes at a time resets it forever and the call
     * never ends. That is not a hypothetical failure mode but the exact shaping
     * this file's header describes Google applying to the watch page, and it
     * was observed doing it — an extraction that simply never returned, twice
     * in a row, leaving a track buffering until ExoPlayer gave up and retried
     * into the same wall. Unbounded is the one thing this call must not be,
     * because it is the failsafe: nothing runs after it.
     *
     * It gets its **own connection pool**, and that is the point of it rather
     * than a detail. Sharing [Http.client]'s pool means the watch-page GET can
     * be handed a connection to `www.youtube.com` left over from an Innertube
     * `player` POST, and a pooled connection that the far end has quietly
     * stopped answering does not fail — it hangs, silently, until something
     * times it out. `retryOnConnectionFailure` cannot save it, because nothing
     * is failing. That is exactly the shape the measurements have: a first
     * attempt that burns the whole ceiling and a second, on a fresh connection,
     * that succeeds in 2.2 seconds. Its own pool means extraction never
     * inherits a socket some other part of the app finished with.
     *
     * Sharing the pool was never required, either. The address-family argument
     * in [Http] is about a googlevideo media fetch matching the `player`
     * request that minted its URL; this fetches HTML from `www.youtube.com`,
     * and the googlevideo URL it comes back with is fetched later through
     * [Http.client] regardless.
     *
     * The ceiling is sized against a healthy extraction — about two seconds —
     * rather than against patience. Twelve is generous enough that a merely
     * slow page still completes, and short enough that a hung one costs a few
     * seconds before [EXTRACTION_ATTEMPTS] tries again on a new connection,
     * instead of half a minute of silence.

     * It is asked *after* that walk rather than ahead of it because of what it
     * costs when it doesn't work. WEB_REMIX is a web client, so its formats
     * come back ciphered without exception, so this is the one path that has to
     * solve a signature on every single track — and a signature that cannot be
     * solved is not a cheap no. Ahead of the walk that made every track pay for
     * the most expensive failure available before anything cheaper was tried;
     * behind it, the clients that answer in one round trip get their say first
     * and this is reached only on tracks that were already failing. See
     * [jsPlayerMutex] for what the expensive failure actually was.
     *
     * Anything short of a working URL — no cookie, a refusal, a format that
     * won't unlock, a probe that fails — falls through to null rather than
     * throwing, so a bad guess here never costs more than the one round trip.

     * As [resolve], but for a file being kept rather than a stream being heard:

     * The format is not a preference here, it is the only option. Every
     * adaptive audio format YouTube offers is either AAC in MP4 or Opus (or
     * Vorbis) in WebM, and Android's media store will not mint a row in the
     * audio collection for `audio/webm` — measured on-device as
     * `IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported MIME type audio/webm` out of
     * `ContentResolver.insert`, thrown before a single byte had been fetched.
     * So every download this app offered failed, and Opus being the better
     * codec of the two never got to matter.
     *
     * Which is why there is no "best available" fallback below any more. A
     * walk that ends by taking whatever the last client offered ends by
     * taking WebM, and a WebM the store refuses is not a worse download, it
     * is no download — so running out of AAC is a failure with a sentence
     * attached rather than something to work around. It is not a common one:
     * the AAC ladder is on essentially every track, rather more reliably than
     * Opus was.
     *
     * MP4 is still demanded across *every* client before any of them is
     * allowed to give up, because a per-client walk cannot tell a client that
     * has no MP4 from a client that has been refused the track. Player
     * responses are shared between the passes, so the second costs the probes
     * again but not the round trips.
     *
     * Nothing here touches [recent]. That cache exists to keep ExoPlayer's
     * re-opens off the network, and its entries are picked under the quality
     * ceiling — seeding it with an unbudgeted URL would quietly hand a capped
     * connection the stream it was capped to avoid, and reading from it would
     * hand a download whatever bitrate playback happened to settle for.
     *
     * The whole thing is attempted twice, for the case where a client is turned
     * away with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot": [playerStream] mints a
     * fresh visitor id and retries that one client, but `mintedFreshVisitor` is
     * scoped to a single walk, so a bot check late in the list burns the retry
     * and the new id benefits only the *next* resolve. The second walk is what
     * turns that into one download that works. It is worth knowing what it
     * cannot do: a client whose URL failed to probe was stood down by that
     * failure and is skipped on the way round again, so the second attempt is
     * the same walk minus its refusals, not a clean one. Bot checks it can fix;
     * refusals it cannot.
     *
     * Which is why extraction sits behind both. When every client is refusing
     * — the observed state, with the VR clients bot-checked and iOS minting
     * URLs that 403 — [resolve] still gets audio, because it falls through to
     * NewPipe and re-derives the URL itself. A download reaching the same wall
     * has to do the same thing or it fails while the track it is refusing to
     * save is audibly playing.

     * than one track at once by design (a track playing while its successor

     * so two resolves can enter these calls together; the library was never
     * written for that, and serializing access is what keeps concurrent
     * resolves from corrupting that shared state.
     *
     * A failure here is passed straight out, and deliberately so. An earlier
     * version answered one by calling [clearAllCaches] and running the block
     * again, on the reasoning that the library caches a *failed* parse's
     * exception and replays it forever, so one bad parse would otherwise be
     * permanent for the process. Measured, that cure was far worse than the
     * disease, for two reasons that only show up on a device:
     *
     *  - The failure this app actually sees — "Could not parse deobfuscation
     *    function" against a `base.js` this NewPipe release doesn't understand
     *    — is deterministic. Re-fetching the script and parsing it again cannot
     *    end differently, so the retry only ever bought a second failure, at
     *    5s to 55s a time, holding this mutex while every concurrent resolve
     *    queued behind it.
     *  - [clearAllCaches] is all-or-nothing. It throws away the parsed player
     *    JS that the *working* paths depend on — the `n` parameter transform
     *    that [newPipeStream] runs for every format it extracts — along with
     *    the one broken function. So the price of the retry was charged twice:
     *    once here, and again on the fallback that was about to succeed, which
     *    went from 2.7s warm to 49.8s against the cache this had just emptied.
     *
     * Left alone, the cached exception makes the failure free — it is what
     * turns a broken signature solve into the ~0ms no it should always have
     * been, and what lets the walk move on to something that works. The cost
     * of not clearing is that a parse which failed for a reason that has since
     * passed stays failed until the process restarts; that is a real loss, and
     * a much smaller one than a fifty-second track.

     * watch page is the small part; the expensive part is running YouTube's
     * player JavaScript through Rhino to transform each format's `n`
     * parameter, which is CPU work on a phone against static state NewPipe
     * shares process-wide. Run concurrently it does not share out, it
     * collapses — measured on-device at 1.8s alone, 16.2s with two in flight
     * (both finishing within 35ms of each other, which is the tell), and 30.3s
     * with three. Read-ahead is what puts three or four in flight: the track
     * being waited on plus [AudioCache][com.music.orb.playback.AudioCache]'s
     * queue warm-up, every one of them an extraction now that no player client
     * is being served.
     *
     * So they are queued rather than raced. Serialised, three cost about two
     * seconds each in turn instead of thirty seconds each at once, and the one
     * a listener is actually waiting on is behind at most one other — see
     * `QUEUE_LOOKAHEAD`, kept at one for exactly this reason. The bound on how
     * long a single holder can keep the gate is [EXTRACTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS].
