/**
 * Publishes what's playing to Discord as a Rich Presence activity.
 *
 * This talks to Discord as a *user*, over the same gateway its own client
 * uses — there is no official API for a third-party app to set a user's
 * presence, so the token in [token] is the account's own bearer token and the
 * socket identifies itself as Discord Android (see [SuperProperties]). That is
 * the only way this feature can exist, and it is why the settings screen warns
 * about it before asking for a login.
 *
 * The presence Discord renders from one [updateSong] call:
 *
 * ```
 *   Listening to orb          <- activityName, or the app's own name
 *   ┌────┐  Song title             <- details
 *   │art │  Artist                 <- state
 *   └────┘  ▁▁▁▁▁▁ 1:04 / 3:47     <- from the timestamps
 *   [ Listen on YouTube Music ]    <- button 1
 *   [ Visit orb           ]   <- button 2
 * ```
