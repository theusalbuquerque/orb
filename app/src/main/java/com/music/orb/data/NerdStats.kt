/**
 * What the audio decoder is actually being fed, for "stats for nerds".
 *
 * Every figure here is measured rather than inferred. Codec, sample rate and
 * channel count come from the `Format` the audio renderer was configured with —
 * the decoder's own view of the stream. Bitrate is the one a container usually
 * withholds, so it falls back to the bitrate of the stream the resolver
 * genuinely chose for that track. Anything the player hasn't reported stays
 * null and is left out of the display instead of being guessed at.
 *
 * [claimed] is the one figure here that is *not* measured, and is kept apart
 * from the rest for that reason: it is what a source said it was about to send.
 * Holding both is the point — a source promising 24-bit/192kHz while the
 * decoder reports 16-bit/48kHz is the single most likely way for a lossless
 * setting to be quietly doing nothing, and it is invisible unless the two
 * numbers are put side by side. See [downgraded].
