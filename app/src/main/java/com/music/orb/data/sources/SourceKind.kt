 * second, always in that order. Adding a source means adding a [MusicSource]
 * implementation and an entry here, which is the point — every protocol the
 * app speaks is one someone can read in this repo, and a source can't teach
 * the app a new way to behave after it ships.
 *
 * What varies per *instance* — which index, whose module — is [SourceConfig].
