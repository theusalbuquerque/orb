/**
 * Where the player gets its lyrics.
 *
 * Four sources, in this order:
 *
 *  1. [BetterLyrics] — Apple Music TTML, per-syllable, keyed on title/artist.
 *  2. [LyricsPlus] — the YouLy+ backend; finest timing of the lot, flakiest hosting.
 *  3. [SimpMusicLyrics] — keyed on the video id, so it can't fetch the wrong edit.
 *  4. [LrcLib] — line-synced only, but it is the one that is always up.
 *
 * The first three are asked *at the same time* and their answers taken in that
 * order. Asked one after another, a miss on each of the first two would cost
 * its own round trip before the third was even tried, and a track with no
 * lyrics anywhere would spend the best part of twenty seconds finding that
 * out. Run together, a miss costs whatever the slowest one took.
 *
 * A word-timed answer wins outright. Failing that, a line-timed one is taken
 * from the highest-priority source that had it — better a whole line lighting
 * up in sync than the right animation on lyrics that don't exist.
