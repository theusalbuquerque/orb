    /**
     * Every module in the index, asked at once, answers interleaved, and
     * nobody waited on past the point of usefulness.
     *
     * Three things, all of which the obvious implementation gets wrong:
     *
     *  - **At once.** A module is a network fetch, a JS load and a search;
     *    done one after another, a three-module index spent three times as
     *    long answering as it had to, against a lookup that has to finish
     *    before audio can start.
     *  - **Interleaved.** Filling the result list module by module and
     *    stopping at [limit] means the first module's tail crowds out every
     *    other module's best hit — with a limit of eight and a chatty first
     *    module, the rest of the index was never asked at all. Round-robin
     *    puts each module's top result ahead of any module's second, so a
     *    track only one of them holds survives the cut.
     *  - **Not to the last straggler.** Asked at once but awaited together,
     *    the slowest module becomes the price of every track — 7.5s against
     *    1.5s for the fastest, measured on the same query. So the fan-out
     *    closes a short grace period after the first useful answer, and
     *    whoever hasn't spoken by then sits this track out.
     *
     * What comes back is a candidate list, not a ranking:
     * [TrackMatcher][com.music.orb.data.sources.TrackMatcher] decides
     * which rows are the recording and [SourceResolver] decides which of those
     * to open. This only has to be complete enough to contain the right one.

         *   https://sp-ad-fa.audio.tidal.com/mediatracks/<blob>/
         *   https://sp-ad-fa.audio.tidal.com/mediatracks/<blob>/0.mp4?token=<exp>~<sig>
         * ```
         *
         * — its own origin pasted in twice, the second copy sitting in the path
         * of the first. Tidal answered 404 to every one. Not an expiry, which is
         * the other thing a signed URL does: the signature decodes to a single
         * copy of `/mediatracks/<blob>/` and was minted an hour before use.
         *
         * Nor is it the whole module going down for a while. Three seconds after
         * the URL above, the same module answered the same `LOSSLESS` request
         * for a different track with a clean Qobuz URL that played — so the
         * fault belongs to *one of the backends a module can resolve to*, and
         * one bad URL says nothing about the next. Which is why this is a test
         * on the URL in hand and nothing is remembered between calls.
         *
         * Caught here rather than downstream because here it is free: no
         * network, no playback attempt, and returning null is already how this
         * class says "I don't have this after all", so [SourceResolver] moves to
         * the next candidate, the next source, and finally to YouTube without a
         * listener hearing anything go wrong. That pays off on both paths this
         * feeds — the live resolve, where the alternative was a track that never
         * played at all, and the mid-song upgrade, where one doubled URL cost
         * four seconds of audition retries before being dropped.
         *
         * Repair is possible and is deliberately not done. The duplicated prefix
         * is removable and the token proves what the answer should be, so this
         * could hand the player a working FLAC rather than leaving it on Opus.
         * It stays a rejection because reconstructing the intent behind somebody
         * else's broken output is a liability the app would then own forever,
         * and the price of refusing is one quality tier on affected tracks
         * instead of silence.
         *
         * Deliberately narrower than "contains two schemes". A URL that passes a
         * target to a proxy — `https://cdn/get?url=https://real/f.flac`, or the
         * same thing in the path — holds two schemes and is perfectly good, and
         * some modules are entitled to hand one over. What is never good is a
         * URL carrying a *second copy of its own origin*, which is what a
         * concatenation against the wrong base produces and what a proxy
         * pointing somewhere else cannot.
         *
         * ### The other half: URLs the player cannot even parse
         *
         * The doubled URL is well formed, which is why it reached a server and
         * came back 404. A separate report — a Xiaomi on Android 14, and only
         * four lines of it — failed one step earlier:
         *
         * ```
         *   HttpDataSource$HttpDataSourceException: Malformed URL
         *     at OkHttpDataSource.makeRequest
         * ```
         *
         * That message is OkHttp's for a string its own parser refused, so no
         * request was ever made. Nothing between here and there edits the URL,
         * so whatever the module returned could not be parsed as http — a
         * relative path, a scheme OkHttp doesn't speak, an unescaped space, an
         * error string in the `streamUrl` field. The empty check above caught
         * only the blank case.
         *
         * So the test is [okhttp3.HttpUrl]'s own, not a hand-rolled one: the
         * question is precisely "will the layer that opens this accept it", and
         * the only answer that can't drift from the truth is that layer's
