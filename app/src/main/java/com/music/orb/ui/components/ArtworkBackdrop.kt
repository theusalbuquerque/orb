/**
 * The colour a surface takes from the artwork it is about: a flat tint
 * everywhere, with the artwork itself blurred across the top and dissolved
 * down into that tint.
 *
 * For surfaces that show no artwork of their own — a sheet, whose whole top is
 * this wash. A page that has the real sleeve above it wants [ArtworkWash]
 * instead: a second, blurrier copy of a picture already on screen only reads as
 * the picture again.
 *
 * Sized entirely by [modifier] — inside a wrap-content parent, pass
 * `Modifier.matchParentSize()` so the wash follows the content rather than
 * stretching it to the full screen.
 *
 * The blur is a one-off: nothing animates it, so it is rasterised once and
 * then only composited. It still needs API 31 for `RenderEffect`; below that,
 * and when the user has asked for less dynamic blur, the flat tint carries the
 * surface on its own.

 *
 * Two soft blobs of the artwork's other colours keep that from being a dead
 * vertical ramp. They are radial gradients rather than a blurred copy of the
 * sleeve, which is the whole point: a full-screen blur of a picture that is
 * *also on screen* still reads as the picture, and the faces in it show through
 * the song list. Nothing here is an image, so there is nothing to recognise —
 * and no full-screen `RenderEffect` behind a scrolling list either, so it costs
 * the same on every API level and under "reduce dynamic blur".
