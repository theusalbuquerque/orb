/**
 * The two decisions [DownloadStore] makes before a byte is fetched: what the
 * file is called, and whether Android will keep one of it at all.
 *
 * Both are worth pinning because both fail late and badly. A wrong extension or
 * MIME type is not a compile error and not a bad-sounding download — it is
 * `IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported MIME type` from inside a
 * `ContentResolver.insert`, several frames from anything naming the track, which
 * is precisely how every download in a build once failed while reporting itself
 * as a connection problem.
